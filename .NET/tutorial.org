* Git ignore auto generated files
To ignore *.NET* project folder compiler files, lots of *DLLs* for code that's
generated by the compiler itself. Now inside our git repository, we don't need
to store code that's auto generated by our compiler. We only want to store in
our code repository the things that we've written. We don't need to save changes
that can be easily recreated by the compiler. So we need to effectively exclude
a lot of this stuff from our git repository. And one of the things we can use to
help us with that is something that we can get from the *.NET CLI*. So If I run =dotnet new list=:
#+begin_src sh
  $ dotnet new list
  These templates matched your input:

  Template Name                                 Short Name                  Language    Tags
  --------------------------------------------  --------------------------  ----------  ----------------------------------
  API Controller                                apicontroller               [C#]        Web/ASP.NET
  ASP.NET Core Empty                            web                         [C#],F#     Web/Empty
  ...
  dotnet gitignore file                         gitignore,.gitignore                    Config
  ...
#+end_src
 and take a look whats available inside here, then we have inside this list
somewhere is a =dotnet gitignore file=. And we can create this command:
#+begin_src sh
  dotnet new gitignore
#+end_src
and it's going to automatically contain the configuration which is going to
ignore all of those files that are auto generated by the compiler.

- Now another thing we might want to exclude from saving into our source control
  is possibly: ~appsettings.json~ as well. Because this is gonna contain our
  configuration. There will be sensitive information (/eg. API keys, secret
  strings/) that we don't want anyone else to see on a public GitHub repository.

* Migrations
Update Database schema using migrations:
~dotnet ef migrations add UserEntityUpdated~

- Apply Migrations
  ~dotnet ef database update~
* Angular
To see which =Angular= version we have Installed, we can use CLI command: =ng version= or =ng v=.
** Install Angular CLI
#+begin_src sh
  $ npm install -g @angular/cli
  # And you want to Install specific version of Angular
  $ npm install -g @angular/cli@17 # --version 17
#+end_src

** ngx-bootstrap
*** Installation
- Angular CLI way
  =ng add ngx-bootstrap=
- Manual way
  =npm install ngx-bootstrap --save=
- Install bootstrap with font-awesome
  =npm install ngx-bootstrap bootstrap font-awesome=
- And to Install a specific version of bootstrap, you can mention it in:
  =npm install ngx-bootstrap@20 bootstrap font-awesome=
** Create Components
=ng generate --help=
=ng generate component=
=ng g c --help=
=ng g c nav --dry-run= (nav is the name of component) NOTE: The `--dry-run` option means no changes were made.
=ng g c nav --skip-tests=
- generate a service: =ng g s _services/account --dry-run=
* SQLite
~sqlite3 /home/likhon/dotnet/DatingApp/API/dating.db~
