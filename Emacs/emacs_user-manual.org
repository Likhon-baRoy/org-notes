:DRAWERNAME:
📝 *NOTE:* (/for Beginners/) I personally prefer Emacs built-in TUTORIAL first,
which is very well documented and easy to understand. In this documentation I'll use
=Ctrl= as =C=, =Alt= as =M=, =Shift= as =S=, =Space= as =SPC= and =BackSpace= as
=BS=. \\

/This documentation is still in progress, so you better stick to it. cheers!/ 🍻

+ Make cursor jump back to the previous position:

- =C-SPC= =C-SPC=
  - set mark (activates and then deactivates region) pushes the current position
    to the mark ring (without leaving it active).
  - Emacs let you save the position of the cursor by pressing ~C-space C-space~.

- =C-u= =C-SPC=
  - When you are in another part of the document, jump back with ~C-u C-space~.
  - move to previous mark pops the mark ring, jumping to the previous
    position. You can use this repeatedly to navigate through the entire ring.

** Exchange point and mark

- =C-x= =C-x= (=exchange-point-and-mark=)
  - Which is very useful for jumping between two locations. It also activates
    the =mark-or-region=, use =C-SPC= to clear the highlighting.

  - Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.  This
    command works even when the mark is not active, and it reactivates the mark.

  - If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix ARG deactivates the mark if it is
    active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If Transient Mark mode is
    off, a prefix ARG enables Transient Mark mode temporarily.

** Block editing
- =C-x C-@= */* =C-x C-SPC=

  - (pop-global-mark) Pop off global mark ring and jump to the top location.
    The global mark ring is updated automatically

** Recursive Editing

Let's say you are in middle of a long search and replace operation, and you
happen to notice a different change you want to make.  At such a times, it can
be inconvenient to stop what you are doing just to make a single change.
However, if you wait until your search and replace operation is finished, you
may forgot what it was you wanted to change.

Instead you can press =C-r=. This pauses the search and replace, and put you back
into a recursive editing environment.  You can now make any change you want.
When you are finished, press =M-C-c=.  This will stop recursive editing and return
you to the search and replace operation, exactly where you left.  Or, =C-]=
(abort-recursive-editing)

Whenever you press =C-r=, Emacs will put square brackets =[= and =]= around the name
of the mode on your modeline.

Another way to start recursive editing during a search and replace operation is
by pressing =C-w=.  This will delete the current matching pattern and then start
recursive editing.

| Keystrokes  | Description           |

*** Regular Expression
In order to mark the items that are matched by the search terms.
+ =%= and then =m=
Let's search for all the files whose ending is =.el= by entering /\.el/ in minibuffer.

Now you can see item has been marked is by the astrict(=*=) sign on the left side of window.

+ Toggle the mark by pressing: *t*
It'll reverse the matching terms. So instead of matching items, it do reverse of selection.

*** Command History and Prompt Key Bindings

Eshell comes with a feature-rich command history facility.  Because Eshell does not use comint-mode it does not have all the history features available to it, but most of the common ones do exist.

- M-r / M-s
  - Search backwards or forwards for a command by regexp
- M-p / M-n
  - Goes backwards or forwards in the command history list
- C-c C-p / C-c C-n
  - Jump to the previous or next command prompt in Eshell
- C-c M-r / C-c M-s
  - Jumps to the previous or next command that shares the command currently used as input. So it jumps to other instances of the command foo if that is the current input.
- C-c C-o
  - Kills the output of the previous command.
- C-a / C-e
  - Move to the beginning or end of line.

+ Unfortunately, the search-as-you-type history search in =M-x= shell (bound to =M-r=) is not implemented in Eshell.

Because I program a lot, I tend to use M-m instead of C-a to move to the beginning of the line. M-m skips indentation and moves to the first non-whitespace char, unlike C-a.

That command does not work in Eshell, for obvious reasons, but you can rebind it to the same key as C-a:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd "M-m") 'eshell-bol)
#+END_SRC

*** History Interaction

You can rewrite previous commands found in Eshell’s history. The syntax is similar to what you find in bash, but it’s just a subset of the most common features. It’s probably easier to refer you to the bash info manual for detailed information on how the history interaction works. I’ve included a small table below that describes most of the history syntax Eshell supports.

You may also want to read my article on Shell & Comint Secrets: History commands. Although it concerns comint-mode-derived things, it’s useful to know about anyway.

- =!!=
  - Repeats the last command
- =!ls=
  - Repeats the last command beginning with ls
- =!?ls=
  - Repeats the last command containing ls
- =!ls:n=
  - Extract the nth argument from the last command beginning with ls
- =!ls<tab>=
  - Using pcomplete, show completion results matches ls
- =^old^new=
  - Quick substitution. Using the last command, replaceold with new and run it again. Appears to be buggy.
- =$_=
  - Returns the last parameter in the last executed command.

Eshell also has some support for bash history modifiers (like !!:s/old/new/) and the bash reference on history interaction would be a good place to brush up on that.
Commandline Interaction
The Eshell Prompt

You can customize the Eshell prompt by modifying eshell-prompt-function, a variable that takes a function that defines what the prompt should contain. By relegating prompt configuration to elisp you can do just about anything you like with it. The only problem is, of course, that Eshell will need to be told what the prompt “looks” like, so you must also edit the variable eshell-prompt-regexp so Eshell knows what the prompt is.

Instead of going to the trouble of changing it yourself, you can give the package Eshell prompt extras a try.
The Command Line

You can use \ to escape newlines and it supports rudimentary multi-line input that way.

Another way of doing multi-line literal strings is with single quotes: begin a single quote and hit enter, and you are free to enter text until the closing quote delimiter is encountered. If you use double quotes Eshell will expand subshell commands and do variable expansion. In this sense it’s quite similar to bash, though without the support for bash heredocs.

Due to the way Eshell works, you can even go back and modify the text you entered, in quotes.
Useful Keybindings

Eshell comes equipped with a couple of quality-of-life improvements that make interacting with Emacs and Eshell a lot easier.

- C-c M-b
  - Inserts the printed buffer name at point
- C-c M-i
  - Inserts the printed process name at point
- C-c M-v
  - Inserts an environment variable name at point
- C-c M-d
  - Toggles between direct input and delayed input (send on RET).
 Useful for some programs that don’t work correctly with buffered input.

** Shell History Ring

- M-p / C-UP
  - Fetch the next earlier old shell command (comint-previous-input).

- M-n / C-DOWN
  - Fetch the next later old shell command (comint-next-input).

- M-r
  - Begin an incremental regexp search of old shell commands (comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp).

- C-c C-x
  - Fetch the next subsequent command from the history (comint-get-next-from-history).

- C-c .
  - Fetch one argument from an old shell command (comint-input-previous-argument).

- C-c C-l
  - Display the buffer’s history of shell commands in another window (comint-dynamic-list-input-ring).

** Formatting paragraph with shell cmnd

- C-h i m emacs RET - guide to learning Emacs Lisp for non-programmers for
  reference. * The Emacs Lisp Reference *
* Emacs-client

An Emacs server creates a special emacs process that listens on a socket for connecting to it. This way the initialisation is already done before you connect to it and all configurations are already loaded. This is the actual "slow" part of emacs. And is a bit similar to starting python, which also needs to load its libraries at start.

With the emacs server running, you can connect to it using the emacsclient program.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  alias vim='emacsclient -nw'
#+END_SRC

** What is so cool about the emacs server?

Saving a lot of response time and making working with emacs feel much faster is the obvious advantage. However, there is a much bigger one:

With the emacs server, you can connect to it from the terminal and X Window. Because the emacs server also manages the buffers ("open files" for non-emacs users), you can view the same open file from the terminal or an x window.

Emacs does "chunk-wise" completion of these strings, too? For example,
 =M-x= j-p-p-b <tab>
completes to
 =M-x= json-pretty-print-buffer

+ This is irritating on two levels.
1. The key bindings are on a difficult to use keymap.
2. There’s no easy entry point and there are too many commands to do simple
   tasks.

- These variables can be used to customize Hideshow mode:
+ If non-nil, =C-c= =@= =C-M-h= (=hs-hide-all=) hides comments too.

- ~hs-isearch-open~
 - Specifies what kind of hidden blocks to open in =isearch-mode=.
The value should be one of these four symbols.

- =code= (open only code blocks)
- =comment= (open only comments)
- ~t~ (open both code blocks and comments).
- ~nil~ (open neither code blocks nor comments)

- ~hs-special-modes-alist~
 - A list of elements, each specifying how to initialize Hideshow variables for
   one major mode. See the variable's documentation string for more information.

* Bookmarks

Note that some commands (especially ones which are liable to move you an unknown
or arbitrary distance from your original location) will automatically push to
the mark ring so that you can use ~C-u C-SPC~ to return afterwards. This includes
=isearch=, so after using =C-s= to go somewhere, you can easily jump back again.

| Shortcut      | Command Invoked     | Description            |
|---------------+---------------------+------------------------|
| =C-x= =r= =m= | bookmark-set        | Create / set bookmark. |
| =C-x= =r= =b= | bookmark-jump       | Open bookmark.         |
| =C-x= =r= =l= | bookmark-bmenu-list | List bookmarks.        |

+ Delete Bookmark
  - go to Bookmark and Select by pressing ~d~ than to Delete press ~x~

* Registers

If you're taking advantage of register functionality in elisp, use some
non-conflicting symbol for the name, rather than a char, so that you can't
conflict with interactively-set registers (unless, of course, you want to do
that). \\
The register retains this information until you store something else in it.

- =C-x= =r= =SPC= =r=
  - =point-to-register=, followed by a character =r=. Record the position of
    point and the current buffer in register =r=.

- =C-x= =r= =j= =r=
  - =jump-to-register= Jump to the position and buffer saved in register =r=.

(The mark is not pushed if point was already at the recorded position, or in
successive calls to the command.) The contents of the register are not changed,
so you can jump to the saved position any number of times.

If you use =C-x= =r= =j= to go to a saved position, but the buffer it was saved
from has been killed, =C-x= =r= =j= tries to create the buffer again by visiting
the same file. Of course, this works only for buffers that were visiting files.

** Save Positions in Registers
- =C-x= =r= =SPC=
  - runs point-to-register

- =C-x= =r= =j=
  - runs jump-to-register
  Type any character to specify a register when prompted.

- =C-x= =r= =C-SPC=

- =C-x= =r= =C-@=
  - (point-to-register REGISTER &optional ARG)

* Keyboard Macros

| Shortcut          | Command Invoked           | Description                                                          |
|-------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-x= =(=         | kmacro-start-macro        | Define keyboard macro. (Start recording key strokes)                 |
| =C-x= =)=         | kmacro-end-macro          | End keyboard macro definition. (Stop and save recording key strokes) |
| =C-x= =e=         | kmacro-end-and-call-macro | Playback keyboard macro, can just keep pressing e after first press. |
| =C-x= =C-k= =SPC= | kmacro-step-edit-macro    | Open keyboard macro debugger.                                        |
| =C-x= =C-k= =e=   | edit-kbd-macro            | Enter macro editor, (C-c C-c) to finish editing.                     |
| =C-x= =C-k= =n=   | kmacro-name-last-macro    | Save the keyboard macro for later use.                               |
|                   | insert-kbd-macro          | Insert a saved macro into the file, in Emacs lisp.                   |

- =C-a= =C-SPC= =C-n= =M-w= =C-y=	---Duplicate a whole line
- =C-a= =C-k= =C-k= =C-y= =C-y=	---Duplicate a whole line

- ~M-x~ =eval-region=
- ~M-x~ =eval-buffer=
- ~M-x~ =load-file= =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
- ~M-x~ =revert-buffer=

narrow-to-region (C-x n n) Then widen (C-x n w)

move the point to the end of any sexp and press
- C-x C-e
  - to execute just that sexp in elisp program.  Usually it's not necessary to reload the whole file if you're just changing a line or two.

- M-: (load user-init-file)
you type it in Eval: prompt (including the parentheses)
user-init-file is a variable holding the =~/.emacs= value (pointing to the configuration file path) by default
(load) is shorter, older, and non-interactive version of (load-file); it is not an emacs command (to be typed in M-x) but a mere elisp function

- M-/
  - EXPAND ABBREVIATION - the command abbrev-expand, is an autoloaded interactive compiled Lisp function

- C-M-o
  - Split line at point; text on the line after point becomes a new line indented to the same column that it now starts in (split-line).
- M-m
  - Move (forward or back) to the first nonblank character on the current line (back-to-indentation).
- C-M-\
  - Indent several lines to same column (indent-region).
- C-q TAB
  - Insert a literal \T into your code somewhere.
- C-x TAB
  - Shift block of lines rigidly right or left (indent-rigidly).
- M-i
  - Indent from point to the next prespecified tab stop column (tab-to-tab-stop).
- M-x =indent-relative=
  - Indent from point to under an indentation point in the previous line.

- C-5 C-x TAB
  - you can specify the number of spaces to indent by using a prefix argument

- C-x r t or =M-x= =string-rectangle=
  - This one inserts text at every line in the rectangle.

%% Start by setting the mark at the beginning of the first line, and move your cursor to the first character of the last line you want to prefix:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*Hello
There
▮I am some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

%% Then use C-x r t, enter your prefix (I said) and press RET. This adds the text to each line in the rectangle:
#+begin_example
  I said Hello
  I said There
  I said I am some code
#+end_example

%% If you don't line up your cursor on the same column as your mark, it will overwrite that part of the rectangle:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*Hello
There
I am▮ some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

%% with the same command results in:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I said o
I said e
I said  some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

- C-x r t       - string-rectangle (used to insert any arbitrary text (spaces included) in a selected region.)

%% Let's say you have this block of text and you want to insert 5 spaces in front of all lines.
#+begin_example
abc
def
ghi
#+end_example

- C-x r t M-5 SPC RET   - That will give the below force indented text.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
abc
def
ghi
#+END_EXAMPLE

- IMHO the standard way is:
   1) Go to the top of your buffer.
   2) Type C-M-% for query-replace-regexp.
   3) Input ^\s-+ as regular expression and RET. (See explanation below.)
   4) Leave the replacement string empty, i.e., press RET again.
   5) You are prompted by query-replace-regexp in the minibuffer.
   6) Press ! to perform all replacements at once.

Explanation of the regular expression:
1) The caret ^ stands for the beginning of line.
2) The \s- stands for any character designated as space by the current modes syntax table.
3) The + stands for one or more contiguous matches.

* Projectile
- Simply open any file in the git project using =C-x C-f= and then try running
  command ~C-c~ ~p~ ~f~.

+ Opening a file in a git project will make projectile recognize the project.

- I think your project is indeed considered a project by =projectile= only if
  you have a =.git= folder in it (did you forget to =git init=?). I'm not seeing
  one in your case. You can alternatively add a =.projectile= file
  instead. Everything in that folder containing the =.projectile= file and all
  subfolders will be considered part of the same project.

* ORG
This topic =Org= is pretty huge on it's own. So, I made a separate manual for
=org-mode= and moved everything about =org-mode= there. \\
